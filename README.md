# SURFING APP - DESCRIPTION

- This is a work in progress, a project that I am making, mostly to learn and improve my coding knowledge, but also to try and help others passionate about sports.
- This will be an app that will allow sport lovers to chat with one another and to give their best places of practice or to use existing ones.

- I do not know if I want to make this a public project, since I am new in the world of IT.

## 1. About the app - accounts

- The app will allow users to `create accounts` and all their data will be stored so they can see their past activities.

- Every account can have an `avatar`, either existing or I will try and implement something that will let you create your `own avatars`.

- Each setting can be changed from the `Menu`, in the `Account` part of the website.

## 2. About the app - chat

- The chat will be a `global` one in the very `beginning`, allowing you to `communicate` with users all around the `world!`

`will continue...`
